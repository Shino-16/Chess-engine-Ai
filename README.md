Major Project: Ai chess Engine

Project Goals

1. Create an Interactive Chess Game:
   Develop a fully playable chess game with a graphical interface using Python and Pygame.

2. Implement a Chess AI: 
   Integrate an AI opponent that can play against a human using minimax and advanced evaluation functions.

3. User-Friendly Experience:
   Provide a smooth and intuitive user interface, including menus, move highlighting, and end-game screens.

4. Educational Value:
   Help users learn chess by playing against an AI that evaluates positions using both material and positional understanding.

5. Customizability:
   Allow users to play against other humans or the AI, and to change themes or reset the game easily.

6. Performance Optimization:
   Ensure the AI responds quickly by using efficient board cloning and evaluation techniques.

7. Robust Game Logic:
   Correctly handle all chess rules, including checkmate, stalemate, and special moves.

8. Open Source and Extendable:
   Make the codebase easy to understand and extend for future improvements or research.

9. Societal Benefit and AI Purpose:
   - What is this AI for? 
     This AI is designed to play chess at a reasonable level, providing a challenging opponent for human players. It uses classic AI techniques (minimax, alpha-beta pruning, and heuristics) to evaluate and select moves.
   - How can this AI be helpful for society?
     - Education: Helps people of all ages learn and practice chess, improving critical thinking and problem-solving skills.
     - Accessibility: Offers a free, open-source chess opponent for those without access to human partners or commercial chess software.
     - Research: Serves as a foundation for students and researchers to study and experiment with AI algorithms in a well-understood domain.
     - Entertainment: Provides a fun and engaging way for users to enjoy chess at any time.
     Aim of the Project: 
     The aim is to make chess accessible, educational, and enjoyable for everyone, while demonstrating how AI can be used to solve complex problems and enhance human learning.

Tools used: Python, Pygame, VS Code, GitHub.
